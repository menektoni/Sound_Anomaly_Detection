# Sound_Anomaly_Detection
Project realised by *Belen Alastruey* and *Toni Dom√®nech* at BaseTIS.

The main idea of this project was to develop an algorithm for anomaly detections in sound using Deep Neural Networks working upon image representations of the sound. In this case was the Mel-Spectrogram representation.

It's a mess but I haven't time to solve it.
